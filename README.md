# Disaster-Relief

Basic Idea:
The basic idea of this web application project for disaster relief is to provide a platform for people to connect with relief organizations, volunteers, and victims during a disaster. The web application should serve as a one-stop-shop for information related to disaster relief efforts, including news updates, donation options, volunteer opportunities, and resources for victims.

Working:
The web application will have a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate through the different sections of the site. Users will be able to create profiles and connect with other users, relief organizations, and victims. The application will also include a news section that provides real-time updates on the disaster and relief efforts. The application will also provide a donation section where users can donate to relief organizations, and a volunteer section where users can sign up to volunteer. The application will also have a section for victims to access resources and get help.
